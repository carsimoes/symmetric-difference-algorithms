In mathematics, the symmetric difference, also known as the disjunctive union, of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets and not in their intersection. 

For example, the symmetric difference of the sets {1,2,3} and {3,4} is {1,2,4}.


a = [1, 2, 5]
b = [2, 3, 5]
c = [3, 4, 5]

sym(a, b) = [1, 3]
sym([1, 3], c) = [1, 4, 5]
